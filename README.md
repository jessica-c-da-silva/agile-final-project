IBM Agile Final Project

Final Project Scenario: In this scenario, I'll take on the roles of product owner, scrum master, and developer. As product owner, I'll create stories for the team and organize them into a product backlog. As scrum master, I'll create a sprint milestone and ensure a subset of stories is ready for the sprint plan. As developer, I'll create the sprint backlog and execute some stories, moving them across the kanban board in a simulated sprint.

Our team's task is developing the backend product catalog for an e-commerce website. Stakeholders need the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete products from the catalog, along with features like product likes and hosting on a cloud environment with automated deployments.

We'll use a kanban board to create a backlog and sprint plan. As product owner, I'll drive the process, using my skills to create a new GitHub repository and kanban board, then fill the board with issues that will become user stories.

Stakeholder Requirements: These are the requirements from our stakeholders that I'll use to create the user stories in the Kanban board.
